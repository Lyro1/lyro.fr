Almost everything was either ugly, not fonctionnal, and most of the time both. <a href=\"https://romainbourre.fr\" target=\"_blank\">@romainbourre</a> and \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrigal28\" target=\"_blank\">@jbrigal</a> agreed with me, so we decided to build something that would regroup all those ugly and unusable apps into a single, simple and clean interface that could be used by students, teachers and school staff.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  I learned Angular with this project, as I was in charge of the front-end development. I also developed some of the back-end features, using Symfony.\n</p>\n\n<img alt=\"Stoodent latest design\" src=\"assets/projects/stoodent/2.png\" />\n\n<img alt=\"Stoodent login page\" src=\"assets/projects/stoodent/3.png\" />\n\n<h3>Our stack</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Angular</li>\n  <li>Symfony</li>\n  <li>SQLite</li>\n  <li>MySQL</li>\n</ul>\n\n"

    "article": "<img alt=\"Digitab landing page\" class='leading-img' src=\"assets/projects/digitab/landing.png\" />\n\n<p>\n  We were going to the restaurant pretty frequently with my friends, and we always had this lame moment when everyone has to look for what they ordered in order to know who needs to pay what. So I decided I could build an app that would do exactly that: list what everyone ordered, and make sure that everyone know how much he should pay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  I built the entire system using Angular and Symfony, but since I wanted to get the orders very easily, I also used an OCR system to automaticaly scan bills. I also built a real time service, so everyone could connect on the same table, see who is connected and make sure that the orders are splitted correctly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This project had two main issues: \n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      First, even if the bill scanner was working (which was not always the case), everyone had to pick their order. So the core problem I built the app for was not fixed.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      You could not pay directly in the app, even if it was the ambition.\n    </li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  And a few months later, SundayApp came to life, so it made this project basically useless. I still enjoyed a lot doing it a I learned a lot from it.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"flex-3\">\n  <img alt=\"Digitab mobile list of table\" src=\"assets/projects/digitab/1.png\" />\n  <img alt=\"Digitab mobile table page\" src=\"assets/projects/digitab/2.png\" />\n  <img alt=\"Digitab mobile payement page\" src=\"assets/projects/digitab/3.png\" />\n</div>\n\n<h3>Our stack</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Angular</li>\n  <li>Symfony</li>\n  <li>MySQL</li>\n</ul>\n\n"

And obviously, as soon as we identified a problem, we decided to try and help.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  At the time, there was very little information about Covid-19 test centers. So, with <a href=\"https://romainbourre.fr\" target=\"_blank\">@romainbourre</a>, we implemented a very simple website that was supposed to let people report the test center near them. And on a daily basis, we would produce a CSV file that would be sent to the Google Maps and Apple Maps teams, so they could integrate it in their apps and make sure that people could easily look for their nearest test centers. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This website was done, but never really used. However, it was pretty fun to build it in a kind of speedrun fashion.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Our stack</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Angular</li>\n  <li>Symfony</li>\n  <li>MySQL</li>\n</ul>\n\n"
