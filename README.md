# LYRO

This is the 8th version of my personal website. 

It is a homemade, handcrafted version of a very light 
macOS in a MacBook Pro, with apps that have been designed
to present me and my work.

### Can I use it?

I published it as a demonstration of my work, and you are
free to use it as long as you do both things:
- Mention my name and link my project.
- Differentiate it enough from my personal website.

Please note that this is not a template, you should not just
replace text and content.

### Hi there, I found an issue...

Well, I am not perfect, so don't hesitate to open an Issue
describing what your issue was. If you can, share a screenshot
or a screen recording showing exactly what the problem is, it
will be way easier for me to fix it.

### Hey man, I think this could be a great idea!

Sure! I am very open to any suggestion or improvements on this
website. Don't hesitate to suggest stuff in an Issue!
